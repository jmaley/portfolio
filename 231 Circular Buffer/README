ABOUT:
  This was a lab assignment for my Intro to Computer Organization course (CPSC231).
  It implements a circular character buffer using C and SPARC ASM.

  This program demonstrates working knowledge with an assembly language.

  Executing the program will prompt the user to either put a new character into the buffer, remove a character, print the buffer, or quit. The buffer acts in a LIFO order.

USAGE:
  Execute the 'run' script to compile the C and m4 files into an executable.
  Run with ./a.out

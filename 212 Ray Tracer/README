ABOUT:
This program was developed during my Algorithms and Data Structures course (CPSC212).
Essentially, it reads objects from input (spheres, planes, lights, etc) and draws them
to standard out.

It demonstrates mastery of C++, object oriented principles, and data structures.
Key features include a k-d tree to query/store photons and use of openMP for multi-core rendering.

Please note this was developed early in my programming career and should not be used as an example of good style (there are inconsistencies in naming schemes, indentations, and formatting).


USAGE:
use the command 'make' to build the executable 'main'
the program reads a "scene" from standard input, and prints a PPM image to standard out
example: ./main < cbox.txt > cbox.ppm
i've provided sample output (cbox.ppm) and its conversion to a GIF format

Each folder represents a course project, where the number in the folder name represents the course number. Additionally, each folder contains a README file that explains the project and its usage.

If there is not time to view them all, I encourage you to at least look at the 212 Ray Tracer and the 372 Dinosaur Tycoon.

Quick summaries of the projects:

212 Data Structures [C++] - Contains implementations of an AVL tree, binary heap, KD tree, and a stack.

212 Ray Tracer [C++] - Semester-long project that renders simple objects with complex lighting.

215 SimpleMail [Java] - An EMail Client using the Swing API.
